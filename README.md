# Testing some javascript in 2017
This is a repo that will handle giving a minimum example that meets
these modern javascript requirements used in many projects:

    - Can use ES6 syntax in the browser
    - Can load modules via require or import/export (ES6) syntax
    - Can render/manipulate DOM via React/JSX
    - Can provide a build bundle, or a watch based build for dev

Blog post to come soon!
